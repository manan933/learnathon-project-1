# learnathon-project-1
Design and develop a simple, sensor-assisted or data-driven system that recommends the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil macronutrients (N, P, K), pH level, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The system should analyze the current soil and weather conditions to provide accurate crop suggestions for small farm holders.
