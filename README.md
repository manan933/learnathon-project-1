# learnathon-project-1
Design and develop a simple, sensor-assisted or data-driven system that recommends the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil macronutrients (N, P, K), pH level, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The system should analyze the current soil and weather conditions to provide accurate crop suggestions for small farm holders.

**#feature of the project:** 
1)it recommends us more than one crop (top 5 recommendation with a suitability percentage), our approach to this output was because when a farmer would need a suggestion , this model will not only give him one option rather it will give multiple options so the farmer would have options wont have to make any type of compromization.
2) as the input data , it personally ask each and every data like n,p,k,ph,rain,temp,humidity etc  , so it would be very much accurate to find a perfect crop to cultivate


NOTE : the project is having a powerfull backend base , as our team didn't have much exposure on frontend we weren't able to develop a beautifull front for it , but for sure in future further customizations will be added to this project which will even be more visually engaging.
